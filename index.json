The recent update to Claude 3.5, released in June 2024, distinguishes it from other AI chatbots with its advanced functionality. This version can process up to 200,000 words in a single instance, making it particularly useful for summarizing extensive documents, transcripts and other large texts. Users can upload various file types, such as PDFs, DOCX and CSVs. Also summarize web pages and address specific data inquiries. Its real-time data training enables it to provide current information on events and topics.\nClaude 3.5 is available via its website, iOS app and Slack integration, allowing users to interact. Additionally, how to ask questions, retry for improved answers and manager past conversations. The platform supports summarizing web pages and uploaded files, with options for rating responses and giving feedback. This updated version is designed to offer a more refined and efficient user experience compared to other AI chatbots.\nCan Claude Bypass a Paywall? Paywalls are systems that restrict access to content behind a subscription or payment requirement. Claude, like other AI tools, cannot bypass these paywalls. However, it can assist with tasks related to web development. For example, if you need to remove a broken model from a webpage, Claude can help by providing JavaScript code.\nHere’s a sample code snippet to remove a modal from a webpage:\nfunction removeModal() {\r// Find the modal element\rconst modal = document.getElementById('modal-OVERLAPABLE');\r// If the modal exists, remove it\rif (modal) {\rmodal.remove();\r}\r// Also remove any modal-related classes\rdocument.body.classList.remove('modal-open');\r// Restore scrolling if it was disabled\rdocument.body.style.overflow = 'initial';\r}\r// Run the function when the DOM is fully loaded\rdocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', removeModal);\r// Also run it immediately in case the DOM has already loaded\rremoveModal();\rBob\u0026rsquo;s your uncle! This code will effectively remove the modal from the webpage and restore any affected functionality.\n","date":"1 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/tech95/","section":"Tech","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Running Claude.","title":"Tech","type":"tech"},{"content":"","date":"18 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nfl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NFL","type":"tags"},{"content":"I provide NFL charts, formations, personnel, schemes, etc.\n","date":"18 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/","section":"NFL","summary":"I provide NFL charts, formations, personnel, schemes, etc.","title":"NFL","type":"nfl"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;NFL 2024 Odds - Week 1\u0026rdquo; # 08/18/2024 # Team\tMoneyline\tSpread\tOver-Under\rRavens\t130\t3\t46.5\rChiefs\t-148\t-2.5\t46.5\rPackers\t114\t2\t48.5\rEagles\t-120\t-1.5\t48.5\rSteelers\t122\t2.5\t42.5\rFalcons\t-135\t-2.5\t43\rCardinals\t250\t6.5\t48\rBills\t-270\t-6.5\t48.5\rTitans\t180\t4.5\t43\rBears\t-205\t-4\t43.5\rPatriots\t360\t9.5\t42.5\rBengals\t-450 -9\t43\rTexans\t-122\t-1.5\t48\rColts\t110\t2\t48.5\rJaguars\t150\t3.5\t49\rDolphins\t-174\t-3.5\t49.5\rPanthers\t185\t5\t40.5\rSaints\t-210\t-4.5\t40.5\rVikings\t-106 1.5\t41.5\rGiants\t-102\t1 41.5\rRaiders\t138\t3 42.5\rChargers\t-155\t-3\t42.5\rBroncos\t194\t5.5\t42\rSeahawks\t-225\t-4.5\t42.5\rCowboys\t110\t2\t43.5\rBrowns\t-118\t-1.5\t44\rCommanders\t162\t4\t41.5\rBuccaneers\t-190\t-3.5\t41.5\rRams\t156\t3.5\t51\rLions\t-185\t-3.5\t51.5\rJets\t195\t5.5\t44.5\r49ers\t-218\t-5\t44.5\r","date":"18 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl87/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFL 2024 Odds - Week 1\u0026rdquo; # 08/18/2024 # Team\tMoneyline\tSpread\tOver-Under\rRavens\t130\t3\t46.","title":"NFL 2024 Odds","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"18 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/odds/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Odds","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"17 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fantasy-football/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fantasy Football","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Fantasy Football HALF\u0026rdquo; # 08/17/2024 # Player (Team/Bye) HALF\rChristian McCaffrey SF (9)\rCeeDee Lamb DAL (7)\rTyreek Hill MIA (6)\rBreece Hall NYJ (12)\rJustin Jefferson MIN (6)\rJa'Marr Chase CIN (12)\rAmon-Ra St. Brown DET (5)\rBijan Robinson ATL (12)\rJonathan Taylor IND (14)\rSaquon Barkley PHI (5)\rA.J.

The Ravens\u0026rsquo; offense, spearheaded by MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, excelled with a career-high 8 yards per pass attempt and a 5.3% touchdown rate. Jackson\u0026rsquo;s dual-threat capability was evident as he also accumulated 821 rushing yards and five touchdowns, contributing significantly to the Ravens\u0026rsquo; high ranking in yards per play (4th) and points per drive (6th). The team\u0026rsquo;s offensive efficiency was highlighted by a remarkable opening drive touchdown rate of 42.1%, a significant improvement from the previous seasons. However, the Ravens\u0026rsquo; defense, despite being dominant in pressure and sack metrics, faced challenges with run defense, ranking 27th in yards allowed per carry.\nAs the Ravens head into the 2024 season, several notable changes have impacted both their coaching staff and player roster. Head Coach John Harbaugh continues his long tenure, now entering his 17th season, with Todd Monken stepping in as the offensive coordinator for his second year and Zachary Orr taking over as the defensive coordinator. Key departures include linebacker Patrick Queen, guard John Simpson and edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney. The Ravens have also lost key contributors such as Geno Stone, Kevin Zeitler and J.K. Dobbins, with some of them signing with rival teams or joining new franchises.\nTo address these gaps, the Ravens made strategic moves in the draft and free agency. They added high-potential rookies, including cornerback Nate Wiggins from Clemson and offensive tackle Roger Rosengarten from Washington. The team also signed free-agent running back Derrick Henry, despite his recent decline in explosive run metrics. Henry’s addition could provide a boost, particularly in forcing defenses to stack the box, which may benefit Jackson\u0026rsquo;s passing game. On the defensive side, the Ravens bolstered their edge rush with the addition of Adisa Isaac, aiming to replace some of the production lost with Clowney\u0026rsquo;s departure.\nLooking ahead to the 2024 season, the Ravens\u0026rsquo; schedule presents a mix of challenges and opportunities. Their strength of schedule will be tougher compared to 2023, potentially testing their depth and adaptability. The Ravens\u0026rsquo; weekly betting lines will reflect their need to navigate these challenges, especially given the adjustments in their roster. With Lamar Jackson continuing to be a central figure and the defense expected to adapt under new leadership, the Ravens are positioned for another competitive season, though success will hinge on how well they integrate their new personnel and manage their evolving roster dynamics.\nCincinnati Bengals (2) # In the 2023 NFL season, the Cincinnati Bengals faced a challenging year marked by injury and inconsistency. The team finished with a 9-8 record, a drop from their previous season’s 12-5 performance. Quarterback Joe Burrow, who suffered a calf strain during training camp and later a wrist injury, struggled to maintain his previous level of play. His injury issues led to uneven offensive production and despite a strong outing in Week 5, the Bengals’ performance remained inconsistent. Offensive Coordinator Brian Callahan, along with Head Coach Zac Taylor, noted the need for improvement in scoring efficiency. The Bengals’ offense was plagued by struggles, particularly in finding rhythm and consistency, resulting in a midseason reevaluation of their strategies.\nHeading into the 2024 season, the Bengals have undergone several significant roster changes. Key players such as left tackle Jonah Williams, cornerback Chidobe Awuzie and defensive tackle D.J. Reader have left the team, impacting both the offensive line and defensive front. Joe Mixon, the primary running back, was traded to the Texans and Tyler Boyd, a reliable wide receiver, also departed. These losses have prompted the Bengals to make strategic acquisitions and draft picks to address their needs. The team drafted Amarius Mims, an offensive tackle from Georgia and Kris Jenkins, a defensive tackle from Michigan, aiming to strengthen both the offensive line and the defensive front.\nThe Bengals\u0026rsquo; 2024 draft and free agency moves reflect a strategic approach to rebuilding and bolstering their roster. Mims, though raw, is expected to develop into a crucial piece of the offensive line, learning from veterans like Orlando Brown Jr. and Trent Brown. Kris Jenkins and McKinnley Jackson, both drafted to bolster the defensive line, especially with the departure of D.J. Reader. The signing of Sheldon Rankins adds depth to the defensive line, although his focus is more on pass-rushing than run defense. Additionally, the Bengals acquired Zack Moss to strengthen their running back corps and Geno Stone to shore up the safety position.\nAs the Bengals prepare for the 2024 season, several key factors will determine their success. Joe Burrow’s health is paramount; if he can remain injury-free, the team is poised for a strong playoff push. The defense faces challenges with new personnel filling significant roles. The Bengals’ ability to adapt their defensive schemes and integrate new players will be crucial. The revamped roster, combined with Burrow’s potential return to form, provides optimism for a bounce-back season. If the team can address their defensive weaknesses and maintain offensive consistency, they have the potential to contend strongly in the upcoming season.\nCleveland Browns (3) # The Cleveland Browns experienced a notable rebound in the 2023 NFL season, finishing with an 11-6 record, a significant improvement from their previous years. Despite a strong regular-season finish, the team faced considerable adversity. Quarterback Deshaun Watson struggled with injuries throughout the season, including a displaced shoulder fracture that sidelined him for multiple games. His inconsistency, combined with a severe knee injury to Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb in Week 2, forced the Browns to navigate a challenging season with frequent quarterback changes and a reconfigured backfield. Despite these hurdles, the Browns’ defense, led by Myles Garrett and a formidable pass rush.\nHeading into the 2024 season, the Browns have made several strategic moves to bolster their roster. Key departures include Joe Flacco, Jordan Elliott, Sione Takitaki, Harrison Bryant, Nick Harris and Mike Ford. In response, the team has signed free agents like Jameis Winston and Jordan Hicks. They have added defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson. The draft brought in Michael Hall Jr., a promising defensive tackle from Ohio State, and Zak Zinter, an offensive guard from Michigan. The Browns’ approach reflects a focus on both immediate needs and future potential.\nThe Browns’ offensive strategies and play-calling are set to undergo evaluation in 2024. With Kevin Stefanski still at the helm and Ken Dorsey as the new offensive coordinator, the team is expected to refine their approach, particularly in balancing their use of 11 personnel. In 2023, the Browns leaned heavily on this formation, but improvements in early-down production and play-action efficiency are necessary. Deshaun Watson’s performance remains a critical factor; his $63.8 million cap hit underscores the need for him to return to his Houston form. The offensive line, bolstered by new draft picks and free-agent additions, will play a pivotal role in protecting Watson and supporting the run game, especially with Chubb’s return in question.\nDefensively, the Browns remain strong with a core of returning players and key additions. Myles Garrett continues to be a dominant force, complemented by Za\u0026rsquo;Darius Smith and a solid linebacker corps that now includes Jordan Hicks and Devin Bush. The secondary, anchored by Denzel Ward and supported by Martin Emerson and Greg Newsome, was instrumental in the Browns\u0026rsquo; top-ranked pass defense. The additions of Michael Hall Jr. and Quinton Jefferson aim to enhance the defensive line\u0026rsquo;s depth, addressing the loss of Jordan Elliott. With these adjustments, the Browns look to build on their defensive success and address their offensive challenges, setting the stage for a competitive 2024 season.\nPittsburgh Steelers (4) # In the 2023 NFL season, the Pittsburgh Steelers showed modest improvement with a 10-7 record. The team struggled offensively, ranking at the bottom in several key metrics, including yards per drive: points scored per game and points per minute of possession. This underperformance led to significant changes in the coaching staff, with Arthur Smith coming in as the new offensive coordinator to address the anemic offensive output. Despite these issues, the defense remained a strong suit for the Steelers, finishing 11th in pressure rate and 47 sacks, largely driven by the exceptional play of T.J. Watt, who led the league with 19 sacks.\nHeading into the 2024 season, the Steelers are undergoing notable changes in their roster and coaching staff. Head Coach Mike Tomlin continues his impressive tenure, now in his 17th year, while Arthur Smith replaces Matt Canada as offensive coordinator, bringing a new perspective to the team\u0026rsquo;s offensive strategies. On the defensive side, Teryl Austin remains as coordinator, focusing on maintaining the defensive strength that has been a hallmark of the team. The Steelers have made several key roster moves, including the loss of Diontae Johnson to the Panthers, Patrick Peterson to an unspecified team and Mason Cole to an unknown destination. Notable additions include quarterback Russell Wilson and linebacker Patrick Queen, who are expected to play pivotal roles in their respective areas.\nThe Steelers’ draft and free agency strategies reflect a focus on strengthening both the offensive line and defensive front. They selected Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier in the early rounds, aiming to bolster their offensive line, which has been a long-standing area of concern. Fautanu’s versatility is expected to address their immediate need at tackle, while Frazier is anticipated to secure the center position. Additionally, Roman Wilson and Payton Wilson add depth at wide receiver and linebacker, respectively. The team\u0026rsquo;s decision to trade for Justin Fields and Donte Jackson highlights a commitment to improving both the quarterback position and the secondary, addressing gaps left by departing players.\nThe Steelers’ offensive and defensive strategies will be under close scrutiny in 2024. Russell Wilson’s acquisition is a significant gamble; despite his past success, his 2023 performance showed a tendency to hold the ball too long and focus on deep throws, which could impact the Steelers’ offensive rhythm. The offensive line’s overhaul, with new faces like Fautanu and Frazier, will be crucial in providing better protection and creating running lanes for Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. On defense, the Steelers aim to build on their solid 2023 performance by integrating Patrick Queen into the linebacker core and leveraging the playmaking abilities of T.J. Watt and emerging talents like Joey Porter Jr. With these adjustments, the Steelers are positioned to address their previous shortcomings and compete more effectively in the 2024 season.\n","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl91/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;AFC North\u0026rdquo; # 08/15/2024 # Team: Baltimore Ravens Cincinnati Bengals Head Coach: John Harbaugh (16) Zac Taylor (5)\rOffensive Coordinator: Todd Monken (1) Taylor calls plays\rDefensive Coordinator: Zachary Orr (New) Lou Anarumo (5)\rTeam: Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers Head Coach: Kevin Stefanski (4) Mike Tomlin (17)\rOffensive Coordinator: Ken Dorsey (1) Arthur Smith (New)\rDefensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz (1) Teryl Austin (2)\rBaltimore Ravens (1) # In the 2023 NFL season, the Baltimore Ravens demonstrated a potent combination of offensive efficiency and defensive prowess.","title":"AFC North","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/baltimore-ravens/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Baltimore Ravens","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cincinnati-bengals/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cincinnati Bengals","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cleveland-browns/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cleveland Browns","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pittsburgh-steelers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pittsburgh Steelers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/afc-east/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AFC East","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;AFC East\u0026rdquo; # 08/14/2024 # Team: Buffalo Bills Miami Dolphins\rHead Coach: Sean McDermott (7) Mike McDaniel (2)\rOffensive Coordinator: Joe Brady (New) Frank Smith (2)\rDefensive Coordinator: Bobby Babich (New) Anthony Weaver (New)\rTeam: New England Patriots New York Jets\rHead Coach: Jerod Mayo (New) Robert Saleh (3) Offensive Coordinator: Alex Van Pelt (New) Nathaniel Hacket (1)\rDefensive Coordinator: DeMarcus Covington (New) Jeff Ulbrich (3)\rMiami Dolphins (1) # Miami Dolphins made significant strides under the guidance of head coach Mike McDaniel. Despite facing injury challenges, particularly with Tua Tagovailoa’s health. McDaniel’s adjustments from the previous year led to a notable improvement in their play action game and overall offensive efficiency. The Dolphins’ offense excelled on first downs and late downs, with significant year-over-year improvements in metrics such as air yards per attempt and expected points added per attempt. Their high-powered offense saw a successful season, though concerns about consistency and depth at the receiver position lingered.\nThe Dolphins’ defense in 2023 was robust, particularly in the pass rush, ranking fourth in pressure rate and third in sacks. However, the unit was not without its challenges. The departure of Christian Wilkins to the Raiders and injuries to key players like Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips created gaps that the team struggled to fill. Despite these issues, the secondary performed well, bolstered by the presence of Jalen Ramsey and a strong cornerback duo with the addition of Kendall Fuller. The defense\u0026rsquo;s run-stopping ability was compromised by Wilkins’ departure, with a noticeable increase in rushing yards allowed per attempt.\nLooking ahead to the 2024 season, the Dolphins have made several adjustments to their roster and coaching staff. New defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens, is expected to bring a fresh approach to the defense. The departure of key defensive players such as Wilkins and Emmanuel Ogbah has prompted the Dolphins to invest in new talent through the draft, with the selection of Chop Robinson, a promising pass rusher and Patrick Paul, an offensive tackle. The team\u0026rsquo;s focus remains on bolstering the defensive front and improving depth, particularly in the wake of significant injuries to pass rushers.\nThe 2024 Dolphins\u0026rsquo; schedule will test their ability to integrate new players and navigate ongoing injury concerns. McDaniel and his coaching staff will need to leverage their strategic acumen to maintain the offensive efficiency and address defensive vulnerabilities. With the return of key defensive players and the integration of new talent, the Dolphins are poised to build on their 2023 performance. The emphasis will be on maintaining Tagovailoa\u0026rsquo;s health, capitalizing on their high-octane offense and ensuring that the defense can compensate for the losses incurred in the offseason.\nNew York Jets (2) # In the 2023 NFL season, the New York Jets faced a year of mixed results despite showing resilience and strong defensive performances. Aaron Rodgers was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture and was later placed on IR.They managed to secure a 7-10 record, the same as in 2022. The Jets\u0026rsquo; defense was a standout feature, ranking seventh in points allowed per game and fifth in pressure rate, thanks to key contributors like Quinnen Williams and a formidable secondary led by Sauce Gardner. However, the offense struggled significantly, hindered by Wilson, backup quarterback and injuries on the offensive line. The team’s inability to generate consistent offensive production, averaging just 21.3 points per game, was a major factor in their underwhelming season.\nHeading into the 2024 season, the Jets have made substantial changes in their coaching staff and roster to address their previous shortcomings. Robert Saleh returns for his third year as head coach, while Nathaniel Hackett and Jeff Ulbrich join as the new offensive and defensive coordinators, respectively. Jets\u0026rsquo; offense is expected to improve dramatically, especially with new offensive line additions like Morgan Moses, John Simpson and Tyron Smith. The selection of Olu Fashanu in the first round of the draft further strengthens the line, although he may not see immediate action.\nThe Jets\u0026rsquo; 2024 draft also focused on bolstering their receiving corps and offensive line. The addition of Malachi Corley in the third round, alongside the high-profile acquisition of Mike Williams, aims to provide more reliable targets for Rodgers. Breece Hall, who had a strong season in 2023 despite limited offensive line support, will benefit from improved blocking, which should help him build on his impressive performance. The Jets\u0026rsquo; offensive line struggles were evident last season, with a rotation that was frequently disrupted due to injuries. The influx of new talent should alleviate some of these issues and offer better protection for Rodgers.\nOn defense, the Jets remain a formidable force despite losing key players like Bryce Huff and Carl Lawson. The acquisition of Haason Reddick via trade and the draft selections of Jermaine Johnson and Will McDonald bolster their pass-rushing capabilities. The linebacker duo of C.J. Mosley and Quincy Williams continues to be a strong point, with both players logging significant snaps and solid performances. The secondary, led by Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed, remains one of the best in the league. As the Jets navigate a challenging schedule in 2024, their success will hinge on the effective integration of their new offensive assets and maintaining their defensive excellence.\nBuffalo Bills (3) # The Bills are coming into the season with the second-largest dead cap hit in the NFL at $61.2 million, following the departure of key players like Tre’Davious White, Dane Jackson, Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde. They face a challenging schedule with top offenses and quarterbacks including Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson.\nJosh Allen remains the key player driving the offense. Despite a dip in production last season, he led the league in EPA per dropback and maintained a strong success rate. The addition of Keon Coleman and a larger role for Dalton Kincaid should bolster the offense. James Cook is expected to continue his development, having shown significant potential last season.\nOn defense, the return of DaQuan Jones and the addition of Austin Johnson and DeShawn Williams are expected to strengthen the line. However, the loss of Matt Milano and the recovery of players like Von Miller will be crucial for the unit’s performance. The Bills are likely to rely heavily on their defensive front and the contributions of rookies like Cole Bishop.\nBuffalo’s offensive success will likely depend on the contributions of Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid. The team drafted Keon Coleman in the first round and is expected to use more multi-tight end formations. While the quarterback position remains a strength, with Josh Allen rated as the third-best quarterback, other positions face uncertainty. James Cook showed promise last season, but the Bills’ run defense struggled. On the defensive side, the return of DaQuan Jones and the additions of Austin Johnson and DeShawn Williams should bolster the line, though the loss of Matt Milano is a significant blow. Second-round rookie Cole Bishop may step into a starting role and the defense will need to adapt to overcome these challenges. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s time for Miami AND New York to step up to the plate and hit. Therefore, Bills are moving down to third in the division.\nNew England Patriots (4) # In the 2023 season, the New England Patriots struggled significantly, finishing with a disappointing record, 4-13. The team’s woes were highlighted by offensive inefficiencies and defensive shortcomings, resulting in the end of Bill Belichick\u0026rsquo;s tenure as head coach. The Patriots\u0026rsquo; offense was marred by inconsistent quarterback play and a lack of dynamic playmakers, with Mac Jones failing to live up to expectations and ultimately being traded to the Jaguars. Defensively, the team was undermined by injuries and inconsistent pass rushing, which contributed to their mediocre overall performance. Key losses, including the departure of cornerback J.C. Jackson and wide receiver DeVante Parker, further exacerbated their struggles.\nAs the 2024 season approaches, the Patriots are undergoing significant changes, including a complete overhaul of their coaching staff. Jerod Mayo, a former linebacker for the Patriots, takes over as head coach. While Alex Van Pelt joins as the new offensive coordinator. This transition brings renewed hope, but also uncertainty. Van Pelt’s previous experience as a coordinator was limited, as he only filled in for Kevin Stefanski during absences. The Patriots have also brought in DeMarcus Covington as the new defensive coordinator, aiming to revitalize their defensive scheme. With Belichick\u0026rsquo;s departure, the team is in a state of flux, needing to quickly adapt to new leadership and strategies.\nThe Patriots\u0026rsquo; 2024 draft was focused on addressing key needs, with the team selecting quarterback Drake Maye with the third overall pick. Maye, who comes from North Carolina, faces a challenging transition, working with a first-time head coach and an offensive coordinator with limited play-calling experience. The Patriots also added wide receiver Ja\u0026rsquo;Lynn Polk and offensive tackle Caedan Wallace, aiming to improve the roster around their rookie quarterback. The team\u0026rsquo;s offensive line remains a concern, especially after losing Trent Brown and Riley Reiff. Maye will need significant support to overcome these hurdles, including better receiving options and improved protection.\nLooking ahead, the 2024 season poses considerable challenges for the Patriots. They face one of the toughest schedules in the league, which, combined with the team\u0026rsquo;s recent struggles and roster changes, sets the stage for a difficult year. Rhamondre Stevenson, coming off an injury-plagued season, will be a crucial part of the offense, supported by free-agent addition Antonio Gibson. Defensively, the Patriots will rely on key players like Christian Barmore and Matthew Judon, who must stay healthy and effective. The secondary, featuring talents like Jonathan Jones and the returning Christian Gonzalez, needs to perform at a high level to compensate for the team’s offensive uncertainties. Overall, the Patriots are in a rebuilding phase, with their success in 2024 heavily dependent on how quickly their new systems and personnel gel.\n","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl92/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;AFC East\u0026rdquo; # 08/14/2024 # Team: Buffalo Bills Miami Dolphins\rHead Coach: Sean McDermott (7) Mike McDaniel (2)\rOffensive Coordinator: Joe Brady (New) Frank Smith (2)\rDefensive Coordinator: Bobby Babich (New) Anthony Weaver (New)\rTeam: New England Patriots New York Jets\rHead Coach: Jerod Mayo (New) Robert Saleh (3) Offensive Coordinator: Alex Van Pelt (New) Nathaniel Hacket (1)\rDefensive Coordinator: DeMarcus Covington (New) Jeff Ulbrich (3)\rMiami Dolphins (1) # Miami Dolphins made significant strides under the guidance of head coach Mike McDaniel.","title":"AFC East","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/buffalo-bills/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Buffalo Bills","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/miami-dolphins/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Miami Dolphins","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/new-england-patriots/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"New England Patriots","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/new-york-jets/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"New York Jets","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/afc-south/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AFC South","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;AFC South.\u0026rdquo; # 08/13/2024 # Team: Houston Texans Indianapolis Colts\rHead Coach: DeMeco Ryans (1) Shane Steichen (1)\rOffensive Coordinator: Bobby Slowik (1) Jim Bob Cooter (1)\rDefensive Coordinator: Matt Burke (1) Gus Bradley (2)\rTeam: Jacksonville Jaguars Tennessee Titans Head Coach: Doug Pederson (2) Brian Callahan (New)\rOffensive Coordinator: Press Taylor (2) Head Coach calls plays\rDefensive Coordinator: Ryan Nielsen (New) Dennard Wilson (New)\rHouston Texans (1) # The 2023 Houston Texans finished with a respectable 10-7 record under head coach DeMeco Ryans, marking a notable improvement from previous seasons. The team’s performance was highlighted by C.J. Stroud, who displayed impressive numbers when not under pressure, ranking high in several key metrics. However, the Texans struggled with a run-heavy offensive approach, which limited Stroud\u0026rsquo;s opportunities to capitalize on his effectiveness in passing situations. The defensive line, a major strength, contributed significantly, ranking first in yards allowed per carry and second in yards before contact. Despite these positives, the Texans faced challenges in converting their strong defensive performances into playoff success, highlighted by their disappointing end-of-season performance against the Colts.\nHeading into the 2024 season, the Texans have been active in reshaping their roster, making several key additions through free agency and trades. They acquired Stefon Diggs from the Bills and Joe Mixon from the Bengals, aiming to bolster their offensive weaponry. The addition of Diggs, along with retaining key players like Dalton Schultz and Nico Collins, is expected to provide Stroud with a dynamic receiving corps and more support in the running game. The Texans also strengthened their defense by signing Danielle Hunter, Azeez Al-Shaair and Denico Autry. These moves are part of a broader strategy to maximize the value of Stroud’s rookie contract and compete more effectively.\nIn the draft, the Texans focused on adding depth and future potential with selections such as Kamari Lassiter, Blake Fisher and Calen Bullock. Lassiter, a promising cornerback from Georgia, is anticipated to provide immediate help in the secondary, especially with the departure of Steven Nelson and the addition of Jeff Okudah. Fisher is expected to bolster the offensive line and provide better protection for Stroud, while Bullock’s selection adds potential in the safety position. The Texans’ draft strategy reflects their commitment to building a balanced team with both immediate impact players and future stars.\nOverall, the 2024 Texans appear to be in a position to capitalize on their recent investments. The offense is expected to be more explosive with the addition of Diggs and Mixon, complementing an already promising quarterback in Stroud. Defensively, the revamped front seven and improved secondary should address the weaknesses from the previous season. Aiming to build on their solid pressure rate and sack numbers. With a more balanced roster and a strategic focus on maximizing their current talent, the Texans are poised to make a stronger push for playoff contention and potentially challenge for the division title. Although, it\u0026rsquo;ll be a brutal schedule for the Texans down the stretch.\nJacksonville Jaguars (2) # In the 2023 NFL season, the Jacksonville Jaguars, led by head coach Doug Pederson, finished with a 9-8 record, mirroring their performance from the previous year. Despite a promising start and the high expectations following their AFC South title in 2022, the Jaguars faced several challenges, including injuries to quarterback Trevor Lawrence and inconsistent performances. Lawrence’s year was marked by a regression in some key metrics, such as a drop in EPA per attempt and a less efficient red zone performance. The loss of key players like Calvin Ridley and Darious Williams, combined with ongoing issues in the running game and pass protection. That said, Brian Thomas Jr. is a real deal.\nLooking ahead to the 2024 season, the Jaguars have made notable changes to their roster in an effort to address their weaknesses and improve their standing. The team made a splash in free agency by signing defensive tackle Arik Armstead and adding safety Darnell Savage Jr. These moves aim to bolster a defensive line that was middle-of-the-pack in pressure rate and sack production last year. The draft also brought promising additions, including Brian Thomas Jr., a wide receiver from LSU who is expected to help fill the void left by Ridley’s departure, and Maason Smith, a defensive tackle who could make an immediate impact.\nOffensively, the Jaguars are counting on the continued development of Trevor Lawrence, who struggled with injuries and inconsistency last season. Despite these setbacks, Lawrence showed potential, and the team\u0026rsquo;s adjustments could help him regain form. The wide receiver corps will see significant changes with the addition of Gabriel Davis and the rookie Brian Thomas Jr., who will complement Christian Kirk and Evan Engram. Although the departure of Ridley leaves a gap, these new additions provide Lawrence with a mix of experience and youthful talent, potentially stabilizing the passing game.\nDefensively, the Jaguars are looking to enhance their front seven, which was underwhelming in terms of pressure and sack production last season. The signing of Arik Armstead and the drafting of Maason Smith are expected to provide more stability and pass-rushing prowess. On the edge, Josh Allen and Travon Walker remain pivotal, with Walker showing significant progress in his second year. The secondary, bolstered by the addition of Ronald Darby and draft pick Jarrian Jones, needs to address inconsistencies from last year, particularly from Tyson Campbell and the slot corner position. Overall, the Jaguars are aiming to return to playoff contention by leveraging their offseason acquisitions and hoping for a bounce-back performance from their key players.\nIndianapolis Colts (3) # In the 2023 season, the Indianapolis Colts faced significant challenges, finishing with a record of 9-8 under the guidance of first-year head coach Shane Steichen. The team struggled with a difficult schedule, particularly in terms of run defenses and overall defensive quality. Jonathan Taylor, the star running back, missed a substantial portion of the season due to a combination of injury issues and a contract dispute. The quarterback position was also unstable; we only got to see Anthony Richardson play in four games for the Colts last season.\nLooking ahead to 2024, the Colts are poised for a significant shift, driven by strategic roster changes and a new focus. The Colts have been active in free agency and the draft to address their weaknesses. They signed Raekwon Davis to bolster the defensive line. The draft brought in promising talents like Laiatu Latu, a first-round defensive end from UCLA, who is expected to make an immediate impact with his impressive pass-rush skills. Adonai Mitchell, selected in the second round, is projected to provide a deep threat and complement Richardson’s game, potentially boosting the Colts\u0026rsquo; aerial attack.\nAnthony Richardson’s development will be crucial for the Colts’ success in 2024. Richardson’s athleticism and playmaking ability offer a high ceiling. The Colts have surrounded him with talent, including the addition of Adonai Mitchell and the extension of Michael Pittman Jr., who remains a key offensive weapon. Pittman’s consistent production, including 109 receptions for 1,152 yards in 2023, will be vital as Richardson matures. The team hopes that the improved receiving corps and a more stable running game, assuming Taylor remains healthy and productive, will help Richardson in his second year.\nDefensively, the Colts have made notable upgrades to address past deficiencies. While the loss of players like Jacob Martin leaves gaps, the addition of Laiatu Latu and Raekwon Davis provides fresh energy and depth. DeForest Buckner remains a cornerstone of the defensive line and the Colts are hopeful that Davis can complement him effectively. The secondary remains a concern, with the team needing to solidify their cornerback positions. The development of young players like JuJu Brents, combined with the addition of new draft picks, will be essential for improving the defense. With these adjustments, the Colts aim to build on their potential and make a more competitive run in the 2024 season.\nTennessee Titans (4) # The 2023 Tennessee Titans experienced a challenging season, finishing with a 6-11 record. Injuries, key player losses and a struggle with consistency marked their campaign. The departure of veteran quarterback Ryan Tannehill and running back Derrick Henry—both to new teams—represented significant changes for the Titans. The Titans\u0026rsquo; offense struggled under rookie quarterback Will Levis, who saw a notable dip in performance compared to his college days. Levis\u0026rsquo; completion rate was the lowest among qualified quarterbacks, and the Titans\u0026rsquo; passing game was hindered by poor production from the receiving corps, which ranked near the bottom in several key statistical categories.\nLooking ahead to the 2024 season, the Titans have made substantial changes to their roster and coaching staff in an attempt to improve. The addition of key free agents such as Chidobe Awuzie and L\u0026rsquo;Jarius Sneed should significantly enhance their secondary, addressing one of the team\u0026rsquo;s major weaknesses from last season. The draft also brought notable additions, including JC Latham, a first-round pick expected to stabilize the offensive line, and T\u0026rsquo;Vondre Sweat, a second-round pick with the potential to bolster the defensive front. Despite these improvements, the Titans face a daunting schedule, projected as the sixth-hardest in the league, which poses a significant challenge for their playoff aspirations.\nOn the offensive side, the Titans are looking to revitalize their attack with the addition of Tony Pollard, who will share backfield duties with Tyjae Spears. Pollard\u0026rsquo;s versatility and explosiveness should provide a much-needed boost to the running game, especially after Derrick Henry\u0026rsquo;s departure. The offensive line is expected to be a key area of improvement. Latham\u0026rsquo;s transition to left tackle could address the Titans\u0026rsquo; struggles in pass protection, where their left tackle play was among the worst in the league last season. The success of this offensive overhaul will largely depend on Will Levis\u0026rsquo; development and his ability to leverage new weapons, including potential impacts from rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr.\nDefensively, the Titans are focused on revamping their front seven after a lackluster performance in 2023. The addition of Sebastian Joseph-Day and T\u0026rsquo;Vondre Sweat aims to strengthen the defensive line, which was previously underperforming in terms of pressure and run defense. Jeffery Simmons remains a key figure, and his performance will be crucial in anchoring the line. At linebacker, Kenneth Murray\u0026rsquo;s arrival is hoped to offset the loss of Azeez Al-Shaair, who was a significant contributor last season. The Titans\u0026rsquo; success in 2024 will depend on how well these new additions integrate with existing players and whether they can improve on a defense that struggled with pass coverage and overall efficiency.\n","date":"13 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl93/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;AFC South.","title":"AFC South","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"13 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/houston-texans/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Houston Texans","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/indianapolis-colts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Indianapolis Colts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/jacksonville-jaguars/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Jacksonville Jaguars","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tennessee-titans/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tennessee Titans","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/afc-west/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AFC West","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;AFC West.\u0026rdquo; # 08/12/2024 # Team: Denver Broncos Kansas City Chiefs Head Coach: Sean Payton (1) Andy Reid (11)\rOffensive Coordinator: Joe Lombardi (1) Matt Nagy (1)\rDefensive Coordinator: Vance Joseph (1) Steve Spagnuolo (5)\rTeam: Las Vegas Raiders Los Angeles Chargers\rHead Coach: Antonio Pierce(New) Jim Harbaugh(New) Offensive Coordinator: Luke Getsy(New) Greg Roman(New)\rDefensive Coordinator: Patrick Graham (2) Jesse Minter(New)\rKansas City Chiefs (1) # In 2023, the Kansas City Chiefs continued their dominant trajectory, culminating in their third Super Bowl victory in five years under the leadership of Head Coach Andy Reid. Despite Patrick Mahomes\u0026rsquo; somewhat off-season, marked by career lows in several key metrics such as touchdown rate and yards per pass attempt, the Chiefs excelled where it mattered most. They navigated a challenging year with a revamped receiving corps that was notably less experienced, relying heavily on Marquez Valdes-Scantling and rookie Rashee Rice. The team’s conservative passing game—ranking last in air yards per attempt and deep throws—suggested a strategic shift toward a more methodical approach, leveraging short and screen passes to maximize efficiency.\nThe Chiefs faced significant changes in 2023, including a notable shake-up in their wide receiver room and offensive line. The loss of key players like Mecole Hardman and Donovan Smith was mitigated by strategic acquisitions and draft picks. Kansas City invested heavily in bolstering their roster, signing key free agents such as Marquise Brown and Irv Smith Jr., and drafting promising talents like Xavier Worthy and Jared Wiley. Xavier Worthy could be a primary receiver for the Chiefs if Marquise Brown is still hurt in the early season.\nLooking ahead to 2024, the Chiefs are well-positioned to continue their success with a stronger and more versatile receiving corps. The additions of Marquise Brown and Xavier Worthy, alongside their investments in tight ends, aim to address the previous season\u0026rsquo;s limitations and provide Mahomes with more dynamic options. The team’s front office has demonstrated a clear strategy in addressing their needs through both free agency and the draft, ensuring that Mahomes has the support necessary to return to peak performance. The revamped roster should offer increased depth and playmaking ability, enhancing the Chiefs\u0026rsquo; offensive efficiency and allowing them to better capitalize on their high-powered scheme.\nDefensively, the Chiefs remain anchored by Defensive Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s experience and the stability of their established defensive core. The loss of L\u0026rsquo;Jarius Sneed and Willie Gay, Jr., though significant, is countered by the addition of new talent through the draft and free agency. The team’s focus on bolstering their defense will be crucial, especially in maintaining their competitive edge in the highly contested AFC. With an improved receiving corps and strategic roster enhancements, the Chiefs are set up to continue their dominance and remain a formidable force in the NFL.\nLos Angeles Chargers (2) # Jim Harbaugh was a phenomenal coach in Ann Arbor at Michigan University, San Francisco 49ers and Stanford Cardinal. I feel like one or two years down the road, he will be in first place in the West. Andy Reid will retire. In 2023, the Los Angeles Chargers navigated a challenging season marked by significant roster changes and injuries. Head Coach Brandon Staley’s tenure continued to face scrutiny as the team\u0026rsquo;s defense struggled, finishing 28th in overall rankings—mirroring their previous years of defensive difficulties. The Chargers’ offense was also impacted by injuries, notably affecting key players like Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, who both spent significant time on the sideline. Despite these setbacks, the team attempted to maintain competitiveness, but the issues on both sides of the ball hindered their overall performance and consistency.\nHeading into 2024, the Chargers have undergone a substantial overhaul with the introduction of new leadership. Former Michigan Head Coach Jim Harbaugh takes the helm, bringing his established track record of success, while Greg Roman joins as Offensive Coordinator and Jesse Minter as Defensive Coordinator. This new coaching staff is expected to bring a fresh approach to both sides of the ball. Roman’s offensive philosophy, which emphasizes a run-heavy scheme, complements Harbaugh’s history of successful team management and tactical innovation. Their prior collaboration in San Francisco is expected to influence the Chargers\u0026rsquo; offensive strategy significantly.\nTo address their needs and bolster their roster, the Chargers made several key acquisitions and draft picks. They signed free agents such as Will Dissly and Gus Edwards, aiming to strengthen their depth at tight end and running back. The draft also brought in valuable assets, including Joe Alt, a highly touted offensive tackle from Notre Dame, who will likely play a crucial role in solidifying the offensive line. Additionally, Ladd McConkey, a wide receiver from Georgia, was drafted to help mitigate the loss of Allen and Williams and to enhance the receiving corps alongside Quentin Johnston and Josh Palmer.\nLooking ahead, the 2024 season represents a pivotal opportunity for the Chargers to recalibrate and capitalize on their strategic changes. The focus will be on implementing a more balanced and efficient offensive approach while improving defensive performance under Minter’s guidance. The addition of key draft picks and free agents should address some of the team’s previous shortcomings, particularly in offensive line protection and playmaking depth. If Harbaugh and his new coaching staff can effectively integrate these changes and maintain player health, the Chargers are poised for a rebound and potential resurgence in a highly competitive AFC.\nDenver Broncos (3) # In 2023, the Denver Broncos struggled through a tumultuous season under Head Coach Sean Payton, who was in his first year with the team. Despite high expectations following the $243 million contract given to Russell Wilson, the Broncos experienced severe inconsistency. Denver started the season poorly, with a 1-5 record, narrowly escaping an 0-6 start by pulling off a comeback victory against the Bears. Wilson’s performance, while statistically impressive in several metrics, did not translate to wins.\nDefensively, the Broncos faced significant challenges. They ranked dead last in several key metrics, including points allowed, EPA/play and yards/play. This defensive ineptitude was a major factor in the team’s struggles, contributing to their inability to win games despite occasional strong performances on offense. The defense\u0026rsquo;s poor performance was exacerbated by injuries and inconsistent play from key players, including Pat Surtain. The Broncos\u0026rsquo; defensive issues were compounded by a lack of depth and effectiveness in key positions.\nAs the Broncos look ahead to the 2024 season, they have made some notable changes to their roster and coaching staff. Offensive Coordinator Joe Lombardi and Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph join Payton in their first year with the team. Key players like Jerry Jeudy, Justin Simmons, Lloyd Cushenberry, Josey Jewell and K\u0026rsquo;Waun Williams have departed. The Broncos have also made several draft picks, including quarterback Bo Nix, who will compete with Russell Wilson and potentially offer a new direction for the offense. The team’s schedule is projected to be more manageable, with one of the easier paths in terms of facing opposing offenses.\nLooking ahead, the Broncos\u0026rsquo; success in 2024 will largely depend on how effectively they integrate their new acquisitions and adapt to the changes in their roster. Bo Nix’s potential fit into Payton’s system could be a key factor, as could the performance of the new additions in the backfield and the wide receiving corps. The Broncos will need to address their defensive weaknesses, particularly in run defense and pass coverage, to become more competitive. With a slightly easier schedule and improved depth. Much will hinge on their ability to execute and adapt to the evolving demands of the season.\nLas Vegas Raiders (4) # In 2023, the Las Vegas Raiders experienced a season marked by transition and inconsistency. Antonio Pierce, taking over the reins and a revamped coaching staff including Offensive Coordinator Luke Getsy, the team faced significant changes. Despite these shifts, the Raiders struggled to achieve consistent success, finishing below expectations. A notable issue was the performance of their quarterbacks, with rookie Aidan O\u0026rsquo;Connell showing better efficiency metrics compared to veteran Jimmy Garoppolo, though neither was able to lead the team to a winning record. The team’s schedule featured several favorable matchups against backup quarterbacks, which offered some respite but ultimately did not translate into a significantly improved record.\nThe Raiders\u0026rsquo; roster saw substantial changes as well, with key players such as Hunter Renfrow, Josh Jacobs and Bilal Nichols departing. Renfrow\u0026rsquo;s exit, in particular, left a gap in the receiving corps, which now relies heavily on Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers. The running back position is another area of concern following Jacobs\u0026rsquo; move to the Packers. Zamir White, with his physical running style, is expected to fill the void left by Jacobs, but his effectiveness compared to Jacobs remains to be seen. The Raiders also signed several free agents, including defensive tackle Christian Wilkins and quarterback Gardner Minshew, aiming to address gaps in their roster and bolster their competitive edge.\nFor the 2024 season, the Raiders have a new sense of optimism under Pierce’s leadership, with the hope that his coaching style will bring a new energy to the team. The addition of players like Brock Bowers at tight end and a potential breakout year for Tre Tucker could provide much-needed depth and playmaking ability. However, the team’s success will largely depend on the development of key players and the ability of the new coaching staff to effectively implement their strategies. The shift in offensive philosophy, driven by Pierce’s vision and White’s running style, suggests a move towards a more physical and ground-oriented attack.\nDefensively, the Raiders are expected to benefit from the continuity provided by Defensive Coordinator Patrick Graham, who enters his third year with the team. The addition of Christian Wilkins should strengthen the interior defensive line, addressing a critical need from the previous season. Despite these improvements, the Raiders will need to address lingering concerns in their secondary and overall defensive consistency to improve their standing in a competitive AFC West. With a mix of new talent and returning key players, the Raiders are poised to build on their 2023 experiences and aim for a more successful 2024 campaign.\n","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl94/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;AFC West.","title":"AFC West","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/denver-broncos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Denver Broncos","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kansas-city-chiefs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kansas City Chiefs","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/las-vegas-raiders/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Las Vegas Raiders","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/los-angeles-chargers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Los Angeles Chargers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/chicago-bears/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Chicago Bears","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/detroit-lions/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Detroit Lions","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/green-bay-packers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Green Bay Packers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/minnesota-vikings/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Minnesota Vikings","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nfc-north/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NFC North","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;NFC North.\u0026rdquo; # 08/08/2024 # Team: Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers\rHead Coach: Dan Campbell (3) Matt LaFleur (5)\rOffensive Coordinator: Ben Johnson (2) Adam Stenavich (2)\rDefensive Coordinator: Aaron Glenn (3) Jeff Hafley (New)\rTeam: Chicago Bears Minnesota Vikings\rHead Coach: Matt Eberflus Kevin O’Connell (2)\rOffensive Coordinator: Shane Waldron (New) Wes Phillips (2) Defensive Coordinator: Eric Washington (New) Brian Flores (1)\rDetroit Lions (1) # Ben Johnson faced a tough challenge to keep the offense performing well, especially with a defense that struggled last season. The Detroit Lions started the 2023 season strongly with a 5-1 record, a big improvement from their 1-5 start in 2022. Despite having a well-performing offense in the first half of games, with top ranks in points, yards per play, and efficiency metrics, the team still needed to address critical issues. One of the main concerns was that their defense wasn’t able to support the offense consistently.\nThe Lions\u0026rsquo; offense was impressive in the first half of games last year, ranking highly in several key metrics such as yards per attempt and yards per carry. They were efficient early on, scoring 250 points in the first half and leading in 13 out of 15 games. However, the team’s fourth-quarter performance was often crucial due to two main problems: a poor defense and ineffective offensive strategies in the third quarter. Ideally, the defense should have thrived when opponents were forced to pass in desperation, but that was not the case.\nTo address these issues, Detroit made significant moves in the offseason. They acquired D.J. Reader from the Bengals, a player known for his strong run defense and improved pass rush. Reader’s impact was evident in his previous team’s defensive stats, where the Bengals ranked first in run defense with him on the field and fell to the bottom of the league when he was absent. Adding Reader was expected to strengthen the Lions’ defense, particularly against the run, and help create more pressure on opposing quarterbacks.\nDetroit also made strategic changes to their secondary by trading for cornerback Carlton Davis and drafting Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw. These moves were crucial for improving a defense that was solid against the run but weak against the pass. With a potentially easier schedule of defenses in 2024 and improvements in both the defense and secondary, the Lions are well-positioned to build on their successful offensive performance and address the challenges they faced last season.\nGreen Bay Packers (2) # In the 2023 NFL season, the Packers experienced a dramatic turnaround from their earlier struggles. After starting with a disappointing 2-5 record, the team adapted their offensive strategies, leading them to a strong finish and a Divisional Round playoff appearance. This significant improvement came despite facing the second-toughest schedule of offenses in 2024. The key to their revival was the effectiveness of adjustments made by Matt LaFleur and his staff.\nThe Packers\u0026rsquo; offensive struggles in the early part of the season were not due to a lack of talent among players like Jordan Love, Christian Watson, or Romeo Doubs. Instead, the problems lay in the team\u0026rsquo;s offensive philosophy and strategy. Initially, Green Bay had a poor goal-to-go touchdown rate and struggled to generate explosive plays, which negatively impacted their drive statistics. However, the team\u0026rsquo;s fortunes changed once they incorporated more explosive plays. Plus, leading to a marked improvement in points per drive, red zone efficiency and overall offensive effectiveness.\nTo address their depth issues, the Packers made strategic moves in the off-season. They signed running back Josh Jacobs and drafted key players like Jordan Morgan, Edgerrin Cooper, Javon Bullard, MarShawn Lloyd and Ty\u0026rsquo;Ron Hopper. These additions were aimed at bolstering their roster and addressing specific needs, particularly in enhancing the offensive line and securing more explosive play capabilities. Morgan, although an unconventional pick as a first-round offensive tackle, was expected to contribute significantly despite concerns about his fit.\nThe Packers\u0026rsquo; 2023 season was characterized by a significant transformation, highlighting the importance of adaptability in football. Their ability to pivot from a struggling start to a playoff-caliber finish underscores the effectiveness of strategic adjustments and the impact of making the right personnel moves. Facing a 2024 tougher schedule, the team’s focus will likely be on building on the lessons learned and continuing to refine their approach to maintain their competitive edge.\nChicago Bears (3) # As the Chicago Bears head into the 2024 NFL season, they are making significant changes to their coaching staff and roster. Matt Eberflus returns for his third year as head coach, but the team has brought in new coordinators: Shane Waldron from the Seattle Seahawks as the Offensive Coordinator and Eric Washington, formerly of the Buffalo Bills, as the Defensive Coordinator. These changes signal a fresh approach on both sides of the ball, especially as the Bears face a challenging schedule against the NFC North, AFC South, and NFC West divisions.\nThe Bears have made notable moves in the off-season to bolster their team. They acquired veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen through a trade and signed key free agents including running back D\u0026rsquo;Andre Swift, safety Kevin Byard, tight end Gerald Everett, and center Ryan Bates. Additionally, they focused on the draft, selecting quarterback Caleb Williams with the first overall pick, wide receiver Rome Odunze at No. 9, and offensive tackle Kiran Amegadjie in the third round. These additions are designed to enhance the team’s performance and address various weaknesses from last season.\nDespite having a quarterback in the third year of his rookie deal, the Bears had the seventh cheapest offense and the tenth cheapest defense in 2023. The team’s struggles were highlighted by their high sack count, giving up 50 total sacks against a relatively easy schedule of defenses. While they did see some improvement in sack rates and pressure metrics after acquiring Montez Sweat, the Bears will need a more effective pass rush and better overall offensive efficiency to compete effectively this season.\nLast year, the Bears showed some progress in their offensive efficiency, particularly on early downs. Quarterback Justin Fields was noted for holding onto the ball longer than most, which contributed to high sack numbers. With Caleb Williams expected to reduce mistakes and the addition of Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze to an already impressive receiving corps, including D.J. Moore and Cole Kmet, the Bears aim to become more competitive. The signing of D’Andre Swift also addresses their need for a reliable receiving back, rounding out their efforts to build a more balanced and dynamic offense for the upcoming season.\nMinnesota Vikings (4) # The Minnesota Vikings are gearing up for the 2024 NFL season with a mix of change and continuity. Head Coach Kevin O’Connell and Offensive Coordinator Wes Phillips return for their second year, but the team has brought in Brian Flores as the new Defensive Coordinator. The Vikings face a significant transition this season with key departures, including quarterback Kirk Cousins, edge rushers Danielle Hunter, Marcus Davenport, D.J. Wonnum and linebacker Jordan Hicks. Their replacements and new acquisitions aim to reshape the roster and address the losses from last year.\nThe Vikings have made several notable moves in free agency, signing edge rushers Jonathan Greenard, Andrew Van Ginkel, Sam Darnold, Aaron Jones and Shaquill Griffin. Additionally, they have bolstered their roster through the draft by selecting quarterback J.J. McCarthy, edge rusher Dallas Turner and cornerback Khyree Jackson. The transition from Kirk Cousins to J.J. McCarthy is a significant shift, as McCarthy\u0026rsquo;s inexperience at the NFL level may lead to some growing pains. Sam Darnold could see extended playing time if McCarthy struggles early on.\nThe Vikings\u0026rsquo; 2023 season was marked by a lack of fourth-quarter magic, a stark contrast to their impressive 2022 performance. They struggled in close games, going 1-4 in one-score contests through Week 5 and only managing a narrow win against the Chicago Bears. This season, the Vikings face the projected fifth-hardest schedule but benefit from the second-highest net rest advantage with +12 days compared to their opponents. This schedule and rest advantage might help them navigate their transitional period.\nDespite the changes, the Vikings still boast a dynamic offense. Justin Jefferson, even with limited games due to injury, continued to be a standout performer and Jordan Addison demonstrated his potential by stepping up during Jefferson\u0026rsquo;s absence. With the addition of Aaron Jones, the Vikings aim to maintain their offensive firepower. As they adapt to a new quarterback and integrate their new acquisitions. Vikings will need to find consistency and make the most of their strengths to compete effectively in a challenging division and conference.\n","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl95/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFC North.","title":"NFC North","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dallas-cowboys/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dallas Cowboys","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/new-york-giants/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"New York Giants","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nfc-east/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NFC East","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;NFC East.\u0026rdquo; # 08/07/2024 # Team: Dallas Cowboys New York Giants\rHead Coach: Mike McCarthy (4) Brian Daboll (2)\rOffensive Coordinator: Brian Schottenheimer(1) Mike Kafka (2) Defensive Coordinator: Mike Zimmer (New) Shane Bowen (New)\rTeam: Philadelphia Eagles Washington Commanders\rHead Coach: Nick Sirianni (3) Dan Quinn (New)\rOffensive Coordinator: Kellen Moore (New) Kliff Kingsbury (New)\rDefensive Coordinator: Vic Fangio (New) Joe Whitt (New)\rDallas Cowboys # The Dallas Cowboys, on the other hand, have declared their intent to go all-in this season under the leadership of Jerry Jones. However, the Cowboys have seen significant changes, including the loss of players such as Tyron Smith and Leighton Vander Esch. The Cowboys also face contract issues with key players Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons, all of whom are seeking new deals. Jerry Jones\u0026rsquo; concerns about a potential $4.5 billion lawsuit settlement have apparently influenced their decision-making regarding contracts and free agency.\nDespite these challenges, the Cowboys still possess a talented roster with impactful players. Dak Prescott’s connection with CeeDee Lamb remains one of the NFL’s premier quarterback-receiver duos and the addition of rookie Tyler Gon should help address some of the offensive line concerns. The defense, bolstered by the return of Trayvon Diggs, should remain strong despite the loss of Vander Esch. I predict the Cowboys will finish with an 11-6 record, slightly down from their 12-5 mark in 2023. They are expected to remain competitive in the NFC, benefiting from a weaker conference compared to the AFC. However, their playoff success will be crucial in determining the long-term future of the franchise.\nExcluding instances of garbage time performance, McCarthy’s 2023 team showed a marked decline in red zone efficiency compared to Moore’s 2022 squad. In 2022, the team excelled in several key metrics, including leading in bypassing third downs, early down yards per play, and third down conversion rate. In contrast, the 2023 team fell significantly short, ranking 18th in bypassing third downs, 18th in early down yards per play, and 20th in third down conversion rate. McCarthy’s strategy lacked a sufficient emphasis on avoiding third downs, which was evident from the team’s dismal #28 ranking in red zone touchdown rate through the first five weeks.\nTo address these issues, I’ve proposed several strategic adjustments for the Cowboys. They should reduce their early down run rate to create more opportunities for passing plays. Second, increasing the use of 2-tight end sets on pass plays could help improve their red zone effectiveness. Third, incorporating more designed runs for Dak Prescott and encouraging him to scramble could provide additional offensive options. Finally, decreasing Rico Dowdle’s role as a short-yardage back might help optimize the team’s red zone performance. Implementing these changes could potentially reverse the current trend and enhance the team’s overall efficiency in scoring situations.\nNew York Giants # The final team in the NFC East is the New York Giants, who present a stark contrast to the Cowboys and Eagles. While the Cowboys and Eagles have strong rosters and potential Super Bowl aspirations, the Giants appear to be in a more challenging situation. They finished 6-11 last season after making the playoffs the year before. Despite having some promising defensive players like Dexter Lawrence and Brian Burns, the Giants\u0026rsquo; overall roster lacks depth and impact.\nThe Giants have some potential with players like Malik Neighbors and their recent trade acquisitions, but the team is still in a rebuilding phase. The uncertainty around Daniel Jones’ future and the lack of significant offensive upgrades suggest that the Giants are not positioned for immediate success. With the team potentially focusing on the 2025 quarterback class, the 2024 season might be a tough one for the Giants. I project a 3-14 record for them, one of the lowest in the NFL, reflecting the difficulties they face in both offense and overall team performance.\nIn summary, for the NFC East, I have the Philadelphia Eagles finishing first and the Dallas Cowboys second, both with an 11-6 record. Despite their identical records, the Eagles edge out the Cowboys based on head-to-head matchups and tiebreakers. Both teams are expected to make the playoffs, while the Commanders and Giants will struggle. The Commanders are forecasted to finish third with a 5-12 record, and the Giants are predicted to be last with a 3-14 record. This outlook aligns with the historical trend of the NFC East, where different teams have won the division each year since the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002.\nPhiladelphia Eagles # The Philadelphia Eagles present a more complex picture for the 2024 season. The roster is highly talented, with the team having reached the Super Bowl in the 2022 season and starting the 2023 season strongly. However, their performance declined significantly in the latter half of 2023. Jalen Hurts experienced a dip in form and the team lost key veterans like Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox. The Eagles\u0026rsquo; performance in 2024 will hinge on whether they can regain their earlier form or continue the struggles seen late last season.\nThe Eagles’ secondary experienced a sharp decline in 2023, finishing 27th in EPA per dropback allowed, largely due to a significant drop in defensive metrics compared to 2022. In 2022, the defense allowed 9.5 air yards per attempt, had a time-to-throw of 2.67 seconds and saw 30% of attempts with the ball held for 3+ seconds, with a 17% rate of throws at or behind the line of scrimmage. However, in 2023, these numbers worsened considerably: air yards per attempt dropped to 7.5, time-to-throw increased to 3.04 seconds, 39% of attempts saw the ball held for 3+ seconds and throws at or behind the line of scrimmage rose to 25%. To counteract these issues, the Eagles\u0026rsquo; front office made strategic moves, including re-signing C.J. Gardner-Johnson, drafting Quinyon Mitchell in the first round and adding Cooper DeJean in the second. Gardner-Johnson is coming off a season cut short by injury, and it remains uncertain how quickly Mitchell and DeJean will adapt to the NFL.\nDespite these defensive challenges, there is optimism surrounding the Eagles\u0026rsquo; upcoming season, thanks in part to a favorable schedule. The team faces the ninth-easiest schedule overall, with their slate of run defenses easing further from Week 7 onward. This bodes well for Saquon Barkley, one of the major offseason acquisitions, who is expected to benefit from the improved run-blocking of his new team. The Giants\u0026rsquo; run-blocking performance was poor, ranking 31st in 2023 and 26th in 2022, with a significant drop in their run-block win percentage according to ESPN. In contrast, the Eagles’ run-block win percentage has been impressive, ranking 1st in 2023 and 2nd in 2022. The addition of Barkley, combined with a strong offensive line, positions him to capitalize on the Eagles’ favorable run-blocking conditions.\nThe Eagles have made changes to their coaching staff, hiring Kellen Moore and Vic Fangio to replace the previous offensive and defensive coordinators. Both Moore and Fangio bring established track records that could benefit the Eagles. Additionally, the team has strengthened its roster with the addition of Saquon Barkley and improvements to the secondary. These moves aim to address past weaknesses and enhance overall team balance. Given their talent and these strategic improvements, I predict the Eagles will finish with an 11-6 record, similar to the Cowboys.\nWashington Commanders # The Washington Commanders, who ended last season with a 4-13 record. This dismal performance enabled them to draft Jaden Daniels with the second overall pick in the 2024 NFL Entry Draft. Despite this high-profile addition, it remains unclear whether the Commanders are significantly improved compared to their 2023 version. The offseason saw some notable additions, but they also experienced substantial losses on defense. While they still retain defensive tackles Daron Payne and Jonathan Allen, the absence of edge rushers is likely to reduce their defensive effectiveness.\nIn addition to the defensive losses, the Commanders also lost Kyle Fuller, who was a competent cornerback and arguably their best at his position. This further diminishes their defensive capabilities. On the offensive side, Terry McLaurin remains a bright spot and there is hope that Jaden Daniels can make a substantial impact as a rookie quarterback. If Daniels performs well and the team’s draft picks are successful, the Commanders might have a chance to improve significantly. Who saw a big impact from their draft class, the Commanders could find themselves on a positive trajectory if their new players hit the ground running.\nNevertheless, the situation for the Commanders still seems grim. While they might not be as bad as they were in 2023, the loss of key defensive assets and the challenge of integrating new players make it difficult to expect a dramatic turnaround. I project a 5-12 record for the Commanders, indicating a slight improvement but still a struggle to compete at a high level. The team is in a rebuilding phase and although they’re managing their cap space well and preparing for the future.\n","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl96/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFC East.","title":"NFC East","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/philadelphia-eagles/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Philadelphia Eagles","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/washington-commanders/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Washington Commanders","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/atlanta-falcons/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Atlanta Falcons","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/carolina-panthers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Carolina Panthers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/new-orleans-saints/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"New Orleans Saints","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nfc-south/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NFC South","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;NFC South.\u0026rdquo; # 08/04/2024 # Team: Atlanta Falcons Carolina Panthers\rHead Coach: Raheem Morris (New) Dave Canales (New)\rOffensive Coordinator: Zac Robinson (New) Brad Idzik (New)\rDefensive Coordinator: Jimmy Lake (New) Ejiro Evero (1 year)\rTeam: New Orleans Saints Tampa Bay Buccaneers\rHead Coach: Dennis Allen (2 years) Todd Bowles (2 years)\rOffensive Coordinator: Klint Kubiak (New) Liam Coen (New)\rDefensive Coordinator: Ryan Nielsen (2 years) Kacy Rodgers (2 years)\rCarolina Panthers (4th) # As the Carolina Panthers enter the 2024 NFL season, navigating both the promise and challenges of a major roster overhaul. The team\u0026rsquo;s most significant change is the addition of quarterback Bryce Young, selected as the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The expectations for Young are high, given his impressive college career at Alabama. His performance in early downs and under pressure will be crucial as he adapts to the professional game and seeks to stabilize a position that has been a revolving door in recent years.\nThe signings of Damien Lewis and Robert Hunt to significant contracts are aimed at solidifying the protection in front of Young. Both players are expected to provide stability and enhance the line’s effectiveness in both pass protection and run blocking. This upgrade is essential for a team that struggled with offensive line issues in the past and it will be critical in allowing Young to perform at his best. Additionally, the Panthers have bolstered their skill position group by trading for wide receiver Diontae Johnson and investing their first and second-round draft picks in receiver Xavier Legette and running back Jonathon Brooks.\nThe Panthers’ draft selections reflect a strategic approach to building around Young. Xavier Legette, picked in the first round, offers a mix of size and athleticism, though his limited collegiate production raises some concerns. His ability to adapt quickly to the NFL will be vital for the Panthers\u0026rsquo; receiving corps. Jonathon Brooks is expected to contribute as both a runner and a receiver, complementing the team’s offensive schemes. The addition of Ja\u0026rsquo;Tavion Sanders in the fourth round provides a promising target at tight end, adding another dimension to the passing game.\nDefensively, the Panthers have made notable adjustments as well, though challenges remain. The departure of key players such as Donte Jackson, Jeremy Chinn and Vonn Bell, has created gaps in the secondary. To address these issues, the Panthers have brought in Jordan Fuller on a one-year deal. Fuller’s familiarity with defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, who was his positional coach in Los Angeles. His partnership with Xavier Woods will be crucial in anchoring the Panthers’ secondary.\nThe Panthers\u0026rsquo; defense faced issues with turnovers and pass coverage last season, ranking sixth in yards allowed per attempt but struggling to force interceptions. Jaycee Horn, a key cornerback, will be a major factor. His ability to stay healthy and perform at a high level will be essential for the Panthers’ defensive success.\nOverall, the Carolina Panthers are in a transitional phase with a mix of veteran acquisitions and young talent. The focus on upgrading both sides of the ball—particularly through the free agency signings and draft picks—reflects a clear strategy to build around their new franchise quarterback, Bryce Young. The success of this approach will hinge on how well the new additions integrate into the system and how quickly Young can adapt to the NFL. With significant investments in their offensive line and skill positions. Panthers are positioning themselves for a potential turnaround after a challenging few seasons. That\u0026rsquo;s why I have the Panthers 4th in the NFC South.\nNew Orleans Saints (3rd) # New Orleans Saints enter the 2024 season in cap doom. Dennis Allen alongside new Offensive Coordinator Klint Kubiak is tasked with addressing several areas of concern from the previous season. Kubiak\u0026rsquo;s arrival coming from the San Francisco 49ers as the pass game coordinator. His expertise in designing passing schemes and maximizing the potential of his receivers. This change is especially important as the team seeks to overcome its recent issues with red zone inefficiency and poor rushing performance.\nThe Saints\u0026rsquo; offensive struggles in 2023 were glaring, particularly in their rushing attack and red zone efficiency. Through the first seven weeks, the Saints ranked poorly in several key rushing metrics: 28th in early down success, 23rd in EPA per play, and 27th in yards per carry. Alvin Kamara saw a decline in his efficiency across the board. His yards per carry, explosive run rate and yards after contact per rush all dropped from previous years. This regression in Kamara\u0026rsquo;s performance was a significant factor in the team\u0026rsquo;s offensive struggles.\nIn the red zone, the Saints showed improvement after Week 7. Early in the season, their red zone efficiency was abysmal, with a touchdown rate of just 37% from red zone drives. However, from Week 8 onward, the Saints significantly improved, scoring touchdowns on 64% of their red zone drives. This uptick in red zone performance correlated with a more effective use of multi-tight end sets. The team’s ability to adapt and find success with 12 and 13 personnel packages provides hope for a more efficient scoring strategy in 2024. That is a paper.\nDespite these improvements, quarterback Derek Carr\u0026rsquo;s performance was a significant concern. Through the first seven weeks of the season, Carr was among the league\u0026rsquo;s worst in several critical passing metrics, including completion rate, success rate, EPA per attempt and touchdown rate. His struggles were a major factor in the Saints\u0026rsquo; offensive inefficiency. The acquisition of Spencer Rattler in the fifth round of the draft provides the team with a potential future. Rattler’s development will be something to watch, as the Saints look to secure a long-term solution at the position.\nOn the defensive side, the Saints have added edge rusher Chase Young to bolster their pass rush. Young, who has shown the ability to be a game-changer when healthy, will be a key addition to a defense that has generally performed well. Defensive Coordinator Ryan Nielsen, entering his second year, will be tasked with integrating Young into the defensive scheme and maximizing his impact. Nielsen’s defense will benefit from Young’s presence.\nOverall, the Saints\u0026rsquo; 2024 outlook hinges on their ability to resolve several key issues from the previous season. The integration of Klint Kubiak’s offensive strategies, coupled with improvements in rushing and red zone efficiency, is critical for the team’s success. On defense, the addition of Chase Young should provide a boost, but the team will need to ensure that both their offense and defense can perform consistently throughout the season. Schedule is not kind the Saints, Week 2 through Week 6 are rough.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (2nd) # Head Coach Todd Bowles, who is entering his third year with the team. With a record of 9-8 last season and a history of unstable performance, the Bucs are at a pivotal juncture. Bowles, alongside new Offensive Coordinator Liam Coen and Defensive Coordinator Kacy Rodgers, will need to navigate a series of changes and challenges to ensure the team remains competitive in the NFC South.\nThe Buccaneers\u0026rsquo; 2023 season was marked by a significant variance in performance, particularly in turnover efficiency. After finishing 2022 with a dismal turnover EPA, the Bucs rebounded dramatically to become the sixth-best team in turnover EPA in 2023. This 56.8 expected points swing was a critical factor in their improved record. However, despite this positive turnover trend, Tampa Bay\u0026rsquo;s performance against top teams was concerning. They faced seven teams ranked #14 or better in total efficiency and managed only a single win, suggesting issues in competing against high-caliber opponents.\nOne of the Bucs\u0026rsquo; major challenges moving forward will be addressing their poor rushing attack from 2023. They finished dead last in several key rushing metrics, including yards per carry, success rate and explosive run rate. The team\u0026rsquo;s inability to establish a consistent ground game was compounded by questionable play-calling from then-offensive coordinator Dave Canales. The addition of Graham Barton in the first round of the draft, a promising center from Duke, should help solidify the offensive line and improve run blocking. The offensive line, while dealing with injuries and personnel changes in 2023, showed some resilience. Tristan Wirfs, who moved from right tackle to left tackle, was solid and ranked 7th in pressure rate among tackles. The Bucs lost key players like Ryan Jensen and Shaquil Barrett. Although they brought in Ben Bredeson and Randy Gregory, the overall stability of the offensive line will be under scrutiny. The performance of Luke Goedeke will also be a focal point as the Bucs aim to maintain or improve their protection for the quarterback.\nBaker Mayfield\u0026rsquo;s performance in 2023 was mixed. He struggled on early downs, ranking near the bottom in several metrics such as accuracy, EPA per attempt and success rate. However, he showed marked improvement in high-pressure situations, particularly on third and fourth downs, where he ranked in the top ten for accuracy, EPA per attempt and success rate. This inconsistency in performance could impact the Bucs’ ability to sustain drives and score consistently. Mayfield’s development under Coen\u0026rsquo;s new system will be critical.\nWide receiver Mike Evans and Chris Godwin remain key offensive weapons for the Bucs. Evans continues to be a top target, coming off a season with over 1,200 yards and 13 touchdowns. Godwin, despite a slight dip in his numbers, remains a crucial part of the offense. The addition of Jalen McMillan from Washington should provide additional depth and competition at the wide receiver position.\nDefensively, the Buccaneers will need to adapt to the loss of key players like Carlton Davis and Devin White. The addition of Jordan Whitehead and the drafting of Tykee Smith should help bolster the secondary. With Kacy Rodgers continuing as defensive coordinator, the defense must integrate these new players effectively and maintain a level of performance that can complement the offense.\nOverall, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 2024 season will hinge on their ability to address their offensive inefficiencies, particularly in the rushing game and consistency from Baker Mayfield. The defense, while dealing with some key losses, has potential for improvement with new additions. With a restructured coaching staff and key draft picks, the Bucs have the tools to compete.\nAtlanta Falcons (1st) # Atlanta Falcons are driven by a fresh coaching staff and key roster upgrades. Under the new leadership of Head Coach Raheem Morris, formerly the defensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Rams, the Falcons are poised for a substantial shift in their defensive and offensive strategies. Morris, who played a crucial role in elevating the Rams\u0026rsquo; defensive unit, brings a promising new perspective that could drastically improve Atlanta\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nThe defensive overhaul extends to the coaching staff, with Jimmy Lake coming on board as the defensive coordinator. Lake, who was the assistant head coach and defensive backs coach for the Rams, brings a strong focus on defensive backfield development and a strategic mindset. This change is critical for a Falcons team that struggled with secondary coverage. Lake’s emphasis on aggressive, adaptable defensive strategies should help mitigate the weaknesses. Coupled with Morris’s overall defensive vision, Lake’s approach aims to rectify the issues that saw the Falcons falter in key moments throughout the previous year.\nOn the offensive side, Zac Robinson, formerly the Rams\u0026rsquo; quarterbacks coach, steps into the role of offensive coordinator. Robinson’s hiring signals a shift towards a more dynamic and high-tempo offensive system, reflective of the Rams\u0026rsquo; successful playbook. This is a strategic move to enhance the efficiency and explosiveness of the Falcons\u0026rsquo; offense, which has struggled in recent years. The addition of veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins is expected to be a game-changer. Cousins\u0026rsquo; presence addresses the Falcons\u0026rsquo; previous quarterback instability and provides a stable foundation for Robinson’s offensive scheme.\nThe Falcons’ offensive strategy will also be influenced by their new personnel acquisitions. The addition of Darnell Mooney, a promising wide receiver and Rondale Moore, known for his speed and playmaking ability. I don\u0026rsquo;t like Mooney for WR2, but it\u0026rsquo;s an upgrade as least. Aside from that, this adjustment aligns with the trends observed in successful offenses under Sean McVay’s coaching tree and should provide a more balanced and dynamic attack. The presence of standout players like Drake London and Kyle Pitts, alongside Bijan Robinson’s potential as a dynamic running back.\nThe 2024 draft also saw the Falcons making strategic picks to bolster their defense. Ruke Orhorhoro brings potential to the defensive line. Alongside him, Brandon Dorlus and Zion Logue are upgrades. The selection of Bralen Trice further adds depth to the edge rusher position. These additions reflect the team’s commitment to enhancing their defensive capabilities and providing a more formidable front seven to support Morris and Lake’s strategies.\nOverall, the 2024 Atlanta Falcons are undergoing a significant transformation, with new coaching strategies and key roster additions aimed at addressing past shortcomings. The combination of Raheem Morris’s defensive acumen, Zac Robinson’s offensive innovation and the impactful acquisitions of Kirk Cousins and new draft picks suggests a team ready to make a marked improvement. While the risk associated with Cousins\u0026rsquo; age and recent injury is a factor, but Michael Penix Jr. is waiting in the wings.\n","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl97/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFC South.","title":"NFC South","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tampa-bay-buccaneers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tampa Bay Buccaneers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/arizona-cardinals/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Arizona Cardinals","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/jonathan-gannon/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Jonathan Gannon","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kyle-shanahan/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kyle Shanahan","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/los-angeles-rams/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Los Angeles Rams","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/marvin-harrison-jr/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Marvin Harrison Jr","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mike-macdonald/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mike Macdonald","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;NFC West.\u0026rdquo; # 07/22/2024 # Team Arizona Cardinals Los Angeles Rams\rHead Coach: Jonathan Gannon (1 yr) Sean McVay (7 yrs) Offensive Coordinator: Drew Petzing (1 yr) Mike LaFleur (1 yr)\rDefensive Coordinator: Nick Rallis (1 yr) Chris Shula (new)\rTeam San Francisco 49ers Seattle Seahawks Head Coach: Kyle Shanahan (7 yrs) Mike Macdonald (new)\rOffensive Coordinator: Shanahan calls plays Ryan Grubb (new)\rDefensive Coordinator: Nick Sorensen (new) Aden Durde (new)\rSeattle Seahawks (4th) # The Seattle Seahawks are gearing up for the 2024 season under new head coach Mike Macdonald, who has wasted no time in setting ambitious goals for the team. Emphasizing a return to their defensive roots and physical dominance up front. Where they focused on bolstering both the offensive and defensive lines to lay the foundation for a robust, Ravens-inspired style of play from day one.\nUnder new O.C. Ryan Grubb. Grubb brings a college-inspired emphasis on tempo and efficiency. The goal is clear: to stress opposing defenses with quicker decision-making and more dynamic play-calling. Moreover, translating into improved scoring opportunities and red zone efficiency. While these plans are promising, it\u0026rsquo;s on paper now. Additionally, Grubb is farfetched to employ a bunch of two tight-end sets.\nThe Seahawks’ 2024 draft class also holds promise, with standout defensive prospect Byron Murphy leading the charge. Murphy’s ability to disrupt opposing offenses from the interior adds depth and potential impact to Seattle’s defensive line. With competition for starting roles heating up among established veterans, Murphy’s presence signals a competitive push within the team.\nOverall, the Seahawks’ 2024 season is poised to be a transformative one and the integration of promising new talent. As they navigate the challenges of adapting to new coaching philosophies and integrating fresh faces into the lineup, but I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s over the top to say the coaches and players will be gelled in Week One. Therefore, I predict 4th in NFC West. It\u0026rsquo;s a tough NFC West 2024.\nKey Free Agents/Trades Added\rArizona Cardinals:Jonah Williams(LT) Justin Jones(IDL) Sean Murphy-Bunting(CB) Bilal Nichols(IDL)\rLos Angeles Rams:Jonah Jackson(LG) Colby Parkinson(TE) Darious Williams(CB) Kamren Curl(S) Tre-Davious White(CB)\rSan Francisco 49ers:Maliek Collins(IDL) Leonard Floyd(EDGE) Yetur Gross-Matos(EDGE) De'Vondre Campbell(LB)\rSeattle Seahawks:Jerome Baker(LB) Rayshawn Jenkins(S) George Fant(LT) Tyrel Dodson(LB)\rArizona Cardinals (3rd) # Heading into the 2024 season, the Arizona Cardinals are focused on addressing defensive deficiencies that have held them back in recent years. With key draft picks like Darius Robinson on the defensive line and Max Melton at cornerback. \u0026lsquo;Zona have made significant moves to bolster their defensive unit under H.C. Gannon. The effectiveness of these additions will be crucial as they aim to shore up their defense and compete in a tough NFC West division.\nOffensively, much hinges on the performance and availability of quarterback Kyler Murray. Despite concerns about his consistency in recent seasons, Murray remains pivotal to the Cardinals’ success. That said, Murray will get $49M in 2024 alone. Under offensive coordinator Drew Petzing, the Cardinals showed improvement in their rushing attack last season. Boasting impressive statistics in yards per carry, success rate and explosive run plays once Murray returned to full health. The challenge for Petzing and the offensive coaching staff will be to maintain their offensive strategies to maximize Murray’s talents and mitigate any potential durability issues.\n2024 season will heavily rely on how well they can capitalize on their offensive improvements, integrate their new defensive talent and Murray. As they continue to refine their roster and game plans heading into the season. Cardinals’ ability to navigate challenges and execute their strategic vision will ultimately determine their success in the upcoming campaign. I\u0026rsquo;m going out on a limb, \u0026lsquo;Zona will be third in the NFC West.\nDrafted: Upside Players\rArizona Cardinals:Marvin Harrison Jr(WR) Darius Robinson(DE) Max Melton(CB) Trey Benson(RB) Isaiah Adams(OG)\rLos Angeles Rams:Jared Verse(DE) Braden Fiske(DT) Blake Corum(RB) Kamren Kinchens(S)\rSan Francisco 49ers:Ricky Pearsall(WR) Renardo Green(CB) Dominick Puni(OG) Malik Mustapha(S)\rSeattle Seahawks: Byron Murphy II(DT) Christian Haynes(OG) Tyrice Knight(LB) Los Angeles Rams (2nd) # As the Los Angeles Rams prepare for the 2024 season, head coach Sean McVay has taken proactive steps to refine their offensive approach. Following a season where adjustments were crucial to their success, McVay focused on reducing target depths on early downs. Also, increasing usage of play-action passes and incorporating more motion into their offensive schemes. These changes are designed to enhance efficiency and keep defenses guessing, especially crucial given the tough schedule of top pass defenses they will face this season.\nOn the defensive side, Chris Shula steps up to the role of defensive coordinator with a mandate to improve upon last year\u0026rsquo;s performance. The Rams invested heavily in their defense during the draft, selecting five defensive players in their first six picks. First-round pick Jared Verse is expected to bolster the pass rush opposite standout Byron Young. I\u0026rsquo;m raving about third-round pick; Kamren Kinchens playmaking ability to the secondary. With a blend of experienced veterans and promising rookies, the Rams aim to build a formidable defense that complements their high-powered offense.\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford enters the season with renewed confidence following adjustments that saw his efficiency increase dramatically in the latter half of last year. With a reduced shotgun rate and more reliance on play-action, Stafford\u0026rsquo;s ability to connect with a receiving corps led by stars like Puka Nucua and Cooper Kupp. With McVay\u0026rsquo;s strategic acumen and Stafford\u0026rsquo;s veteran leadership, the Rams are poised to compete at a high level in a competitive NFC West. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a fight at the end of the season between theRams and the 49ers.\nTeam Personnel\rCardinals 11(64%) 12(20%) 13(11.5%)\rRams 11(95%) 12(5%)\r49ers 11(38%) 21(36%) 12(13%) 22(11%)\rSeahawks 11(63%) 12(22%) 13(10%)\rObviously, new coaches and new schemes for the Seattle Seahawks. My predication is an uptick for the offensive Seahawks.\nSan Francisco 49ers (1st) # Heading into the 2024 season, the San Francisco 49ers are looking to build upon their successful campaign last year. Head coach, Kyle Shanahan\u0026rsquo;s innovative offensive schemes have been a cornerstone of their success, consistently adapting to maximize the talents of his roster. 49ers offensively in 11, 12, 21 and 22 personnel sets highlights Shanahan\u0026rsquo;s ability to create mismatches and exploit defenses, ranking at the top in various offensive metrics.\nDefensively, the 49ers are poised to maintain their strength with strategic additions. Despite some weaknesses in generating pre-snap penalties and holding calls, they have bolstered their defensive line. 49ers added Leonard Floyd, Maliek Collins and Yetur Gross-Matos. These additions complement the return of key players like Nick Bosa, ensuring a formidable defensive front that can pressure quarterbacks and disrupt opposing offenses. Last year, 49ers defensive running schemes were nonviable, at times. This defensive depth will be critical as they navigate a competitive NFC West division and aim to secure their place atop the standings.\nLooking ahead, the 49ers\u0026rsquo; success in the 2024 season will hinge on maintaining their health, executing Shanahan\u0026rsquo;s diverse offensive strategies and leveraging their sturdy defense. With aspirations to not just return to the Super Bowl but to win it, the 49ers under Shanahan\u0026rsquo;s leadership are well-positioned to contend in a playoff-run, again. Rams are legit within their division, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the 49ers ability to perform consistently at a high level. The main goal is determining their chances in the playoffs and the Super Bowl, bar none.\n","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl98/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFC West.","title":"NFC West","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/san-francisco-49ers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"San Francisco 49ers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sean-mcvay/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sean McVay","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/seattle-seahawks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Seattle Seahawks","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Arizona Cardinals.\u0026rdquo; # 07/18/2024 # Head Coach: Jonathan Gannon (Former Philadelphia Defensive Coordinator, 1 year) Offensive Coordinator: Drew Petzing (Former Clevelands’ Quarterback Coach, 1 year) Defensive Coordinator: Nick Rallis (Former Philadelphia Defensive Assistant, 1 year)\nForecast 2024: 5 wins 2023: 4-13 2022: 4-13 2021: 11-6 2020: 8-8\nKey Players Lost: D.J.

The plaintiffs claimed that the NFL deliberately set prices for Sunday Ticket excessively high to coerce consumers into sticking with local broadcasts from CBS and Fox, thus protecting the NFL\u0026rsquo;s relationships with these networks. The jury\u0026rsquo;s conclusion was damning: they found the NFL guilty of antitrust violations, ruling that the pricing strategy unfairly restricted consumer choice.\nThe repercussions of this verdict are substantial. The jury ordered the NFL to pay $96 million in damages to commercial establishments involved in the class action, and a staggering $4 billion to residential consumers who subscribed to Sunday Ticket. Under antitrust laws, damages awarded by a jury can be tripled, potentially ballooning the NFL\u0026rsquo;s financial liability to a staggering $12.3 billion if the verdict stands through appeals. This amount surpasses the value of most NFL franchises, underscoring the gravity of the financial impact on the league.\nDespite the jury\u0026rsquo;s decision, the legal battle is far from over. The NFL has signaled its intention to challenge the verdict through a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Such motions argue that the jury\u0026rsquo;s decision lacked sufficient legal basis and should be overturned by the presiding judge. This pivotal decision rests in the hands of the court, which could potentially nullify the entire verdict if it finds the evidence presented insufficient to support the jury\u0026rsquo;s findings.\nLooking ahead, the case is likely to proceed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals regardless of the district court\u0026rsquo;s ruling on the NFL\u0026rsquo;s motion. This appellate process is a standard procedure for federal cases, providing an opportunity for further legal scrutiny and potentially overturning or upholding the lower court\u0026rsquo;s decision. Given the astronomical sums involved, the stakes are exceptionally high, making an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a conceivable next step if either party is dissatisfied with the Ninth Circuit\u0026rsquo;s ruling.\nThe implications extend beyond financial penalties; they could reshape how the NFL conducts its business practices. Advocates hope this lawsuit serves as a wake-up call, prompting the league to reconsider its pricing strategies and offer consumers more affordable and flexible viewing options for games, whether through cable packages or direct subscriptions. Ultimately, the outcome of this legal saga may not only impact the NFL\u0026rsquo;s bottom line but also redefine the landscape of sports broadcasting and consumer rights in the digital age.\n","date":"30 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl100/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFL Sunday Ticket Trial.","title":"NFL Sunday Ticket Trial","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/distributed/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Distributed","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-add/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Add","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-bash/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Bash","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-clone/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Clone","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-commit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Commit","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-pull/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Pull","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-push/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Push","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/github/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GitHub","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/homebrew/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Homebrew","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mac/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mac","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/macos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MacOS","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Principles of Git.\u0026rdquo; # 05/27/2024 # Let\u0026rsquo;s embark on a journey that takes you from the very first steps with Git to becoming proficient in its common use cases. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, MacOS or Windows, the techniques covered in these videos will be valid across all platforms, facilitated by Git Bash. Without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into the world of Git.\nTo start, let\u0026rsquo;s unravel the fundamental question: What is Git? Git is a distributed version control system, and the term \u0026ldquo;distributed\u0026rdquo; holds paramount significance. This sets Git apart from its predecessors like centralized systems such as SVN and CVS. In Git\u0026rsquo;s distributed ecosystem, each computer that has downloaded the repository maintains a complete copy of it. This feature enables you to work independently without relying on a centralized server. This is a crucial contrast to centralized systems like SVN. Why do we need Git or any version control system? The answer is simple: tracking changes to files is complex, especially when working individually or in teams.\nImagine a scenario where you\u0026rsquo;re crafting a web application composed of numerous files. After deploying it, you decide to make changes locally. Without version control, identifying which files were modified becomes challenging. Version control systems like Git address this problem. Consider collaborating with another developer. With Git, both of you can make changes to the same files without discord. Git handles merging changes seamlessly, resolving a common source of conflict.\nTransitioning to Git installation, the process is straightforward across all platforms. For Linux users, you can obtain Git via your preferred package manager. MacOS users can utilize Homebrew, while Windows users can download Git from git-scm.org. During the Windows installation, opting for Git Bash is crucial to attain a consistent command-line experience similar to Linux and MacOS.\nGit\u0026rsquo;s role transcends version control; it\u0026rsquo;s a software distribution medium. Platforms like GitLab and GitHub act as repositories, housing copies of projects. They often serve as master repositories, facilitating collaboration. While not mandatory, using these services streamlines sharing and synchronization.\nVenturing into using Git, let\u0026rsquo;s explore cloning repositories. Instead of merely downloading a zip file, the superior approach is using \u0026ldquo;git clone.\u0026rdquo; By copying the URL, running \u0026ldquo;git clone [URL]\u0026rdquo; you mirror the repository onto your system. It not only fetches code but also initializes Git-specific components. This association ensures you can update your local copy with any changes made on GitHub using \u0026ldquo;git pull.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s address creating repositories. Whether from existing code or a blank slate, the process remains consistent. Using \u0026ldquo;git init\u0026rdquo; in a folder initiates a Git repository. You can also create a new repository with a specified name using \u0026ldquo;git init [folder name].\u0026rdquo; This empowers you to manage both existing projects and new endeavors effectively.\nYou now comprehend the essence of Git, the role of repositories and how to install Git. Moreover, you\u0026rsquo;ve grasped how to clone repositories, making collaboration seamless and learned how to initialize your own repositories. This foundation equips you to traverse Git\u0026rsquo;s landscape with confidence and proficiency.\nhttps://git-scm.com/downloads https://git-scm.com/docs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\n","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/tech97/","section":"Tech","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Principles of Git.","title":"Tech","type":"tech"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/terminal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Terminal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/windows/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Windows","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/4kp60-hdmi-display/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"4Kp60 HDMI Display","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/i/o-performance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"I/O Performance","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mip-csi/dsi-ports/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MIP CSI/DSI Ports","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nvme/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NVMe","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pcie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PCIe","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ram/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"RAM","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/raspberry-pi-5/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Raspberry Pi 5","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/single-board-computer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Single-Board Computer","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Raspberry Pi 5\u0026rdquo; # 03/30/2024 # The Raspberry Pi 5 represents a significant advancement in the world of single-board computers.

If you\u0026rsquo;re one of these people, you could be missing out on some significant savings.\nFirst of all, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to check your monthly bill for a rental fee, which can range from $5 to $15, depending on your plan and ISP. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a modem/router combo unit, your ISP might add an extra Wi-Fi service fee on top of the rental fee. While some providers offer free modems with certain bundles, you might end up paying more in the long run due to these additional fees.\nIf your ISP allows you to use your own modem, you could save between $60 and $120 per year by buying one instead of renting it. Even though you\u0026rsquo;ll need to pay upfront for the modem, you\u0026rsquo;ll recoup the cost within a year and start saving $10 a month. Over time, these savings will add up. However, make sure your cable company stops charging you the rental fee since they\u0026rsquo;ve been known to \u0026ldquo;forget\u0026rdquo; in the past.\nKeep in mind that if you\u0026rsquo;re currently using a modem/router combo unit, it\u0026rsquo;s best to keep these devices separate. This means you\u0026rsquo;ll need to purchase a separate wireless router in addition to the modem. Although this might raise the cost of upgrading, it\u0026rsquo;s still worth it in the long run, especially if you need a mesh Wi-Fi system.\nWhile renting a modem might offer some benefits, such as being able to trade it in when it becomes obsolete or stops working, and not having to worry about compatibility or replacing the unit yourself, purchasing your own modem offers more advantages. Some ISPs might not even let you buy your own modem. If you have DSL or fiber, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to rent or purchase special equipment from your ISP since you can\u0026rsquo;t use a cable modem.\nIf you bundle your home phone service with your internet plan, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a modem with a phone port. However, telephony modems aren\u0026rsquo;t widely available for sale, and renting might be the better option.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to check your ISP\u0026rsquo;s website or contact customer service to see if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to use your own modem. Most ISPs will list compatible modems on their website.\nWhen it comes to choosing the right modem, PCMag doesn\u0026rsquo;t rate cable modems since it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to isolate modem performance from ISP speed. The best modem for you is one that\u0026rsquo;s compatible with your ISP and plan and offers a good balance of price and features. The best modems support DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 and are compatible with the major US cable companies, including Spectrum, Comcast, and Cox.\nFor plans slower than 1 Gigabit, a DOCSIS 3.0 modem is sufficient. The Netgear CM500, Arris Surfboard SB6183, Motorola MB7621, and Netgear CM600 are all good options.\nFor plans of 1 Gigabit or higher, a DOCSIS 3.1 modem is recommended. The Motorola MB8600, Arris Surfboard SB8200, and Netgear CM1000 are all great choices.\nIn conclusion, buying your own modem can save you a significant amount of money in the long run, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to check with your ISP first to see if it\u0026rsquo;s allowed. By choosing the right modem for your plan and ISP, you can enjoy faster and more reliable internet service without breaking the bank.\n","date":"5 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/tech100/","section":"Tech","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Buy or Rent From Your ISP?","title":"Tech","type":"tech"},{"content":"","date":"5 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/wi-fi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wi-Fi","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
