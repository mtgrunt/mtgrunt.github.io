The plaintiffs claimed that the NFL deliberately set prices for Sunday Ticket excessively high to coerce consumers into sticking with local broadcasts from CBS and Fox, thus protecting the NFL\u0026rsquo;s relationships with these networks. The jury\u0026rsquo;s conclusion was damning: they found the NFL guilty of antitrust violations, ruling that the pricing strategy unfairly restricted consumer choice.\nThe repercussions of this verdict are substantial. The jury ordered the NFL to pay $96 million in damages to commercial establishments involved in the class action, and a staggering $4 billion to residential consumers who subscribed to Sunday Ticket. Under antitrust laws, damages awarded by a jury can be tripled, potentially ballooning the NFL\u0026rsquo;s financial liability to a staggering $12.3 billion if the verdict stands through appeals. This amount surpasses the value of most NFL franchises, underscoring the gravity of the financial impact on the league.\nDespite the jury\u0026rsquo;s decision, the legal battle is far from over. The NFL has signaled its intention to challenge the verdict through a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Such motions argue that the jury\u0026rsquo;s decision lacked sufficient legal basis and should be overturned by the presiding judge. This pivotal decision rests in the hands of the court, which could potentially nullify the entire verdict if it finds the evidence presented insufficient to support the jury\u0026rsquo;s findings.\nLooking ahead, the case is likely to proceed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals regardless of the district court\u0026rsquo;s ruling on the NFL\u0026rsquo;s motion. This appellate process is a standard procedure for federal cases, providing an opportunity for further legal scrutiny and potentially overturning or upholding the lower court\u0026rsquo;s decision. Given the astronomical sums involved, the stakes are exceptionally high, making an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a conceivable next step if either party is dissatisfied with the Ninth Circuit\u0026rsquo;s ruling.\nThe implications extend beyond financial penalties; they could reshape how the NFL conducts its business practices. Advocates hope this lawsuit serves as a wake-up call, prompting the league to reconsider its pricing strategies and offer consumers more affordable and flexible viewing options for games, whether through cable packages or direct subscriptions. Ultimately, the outcome of this legal saga may not only impact the NFL\u0026rsquo;s bottom line but also redefine the landscape of sports broadcasting and consumer rights in the digital age.\n","date":"30 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl1/","section":"NFL","summary":"The class action lawsuit against the National Football League (NFL), alleging price fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws regarding its Sunday Ticket service, has reached a significant verdict.","title":"NFL Lawsuit","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"30 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pages/","section":"Pages","summary":"","title":"Pages","type":"pages"},{"content":"Test Pages\n","date":"30 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pages/pages/","section":"Pages","summary":"Test Pages","title":"Test Pages","type":"pages"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
