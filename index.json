The plaintiffs claimed that the NFL deliberately set prices for Sunday Ticket excessively high to coerce consumers into sticking with local broadcasts from CBS and Fox, thus protecting the NFL\u0026rsquo;s relationships with these networks. The jury\u0026rsquo;s conclusion was damning: they found the NFL guilty of antitrust violations, ruling that the pricing strategy unfairly restricted consumer choice.\nThe repercussions of this verdict are substantial. The jury ordered the NFL to pay $96 million in damages to commercial establishments involved in the class action, and a staggering $4 billion to residential consumers who subscribed to Sunday Ticket. Under antitrust laws, damages awarded by a jury can be tripled, potentially ballooning the NFL\u0026rsquo;s financial liability to a staggering $12.3 billion if the verdict stands through appeals. This amount surpasses the value of most NFL franchises, underscoring the gravity of the financial impact on the league.\nDespite the jury\u0026rsquo;s decision, the legal battle is far from over. The NFL has signaled its intention to challenge the verdict through a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Such motions argue that the jury\u0026rsquo;s decision lacked sufficient legal basis and should be overturned by the presiding judge. This pivotal decision rests in the hands of the court, which could potentially nullify the entire verdict if it finds the evidence presented insufficient to support the jury\u0026rsquo;s findings.\nLooking ahead, the case is likely to proceed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals regardless of the district court\u0026rsquo;s ruling on the NFL\u0026rsquo;s motion. This appellate process is a standard procedure for federal cases, providing an opportunity for further legal scrutiny and potentially overturning or upholding the lower court\u0026rsquo;s decision. Given the astronomical sums involved, the stakes are exceptionally high, making an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a conceivable next step if either party is dissatisfied with the Ninth Circuit\u0026rsquo;s ruling.\nThe implications extend beyond financial penalties; they could reshape how the NFL conducts its business practices. Advocates hope this lawsuit serves as a wake-up call, prompting the league to reconsider its pricing strategies and offer consumers more affordable and flexible viewing options for games, whether through cable packages or direct subscriptions. Ultimately, the outcome of this legal saga may not only impact the NFL\u0026rsquo;s bottom line but also redefine the landscape of sports broadcasting and consumer rights in the digital age.\n","date":"30 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nfl/nfl100/","section":"NFL","summary":"\u0026ldquo;NFL Sunday Ticket Trial.","title":"NFL Sunday Ticket Trial","type":"nfl"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/distributed/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Distributed","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-add/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Add","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-bash/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Bash","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-clone/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Clone","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-commit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Commit","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-pull/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Pull","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/git-push/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git Push","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/github/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GitHub","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/homebrew/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Homebrew","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mac/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mac","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/macos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MacOS","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Principles of Git.\u0026rdquo; # 05/27/2024 # Let\u0026rsquo;s embark on a journey that takes you from the very first steps with Git to becoming proficient in its common use cases. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, MacOS or Windows, the techniques covered in these videos will be valid across all platforms, facilitated by Git Bash. Without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into the world of Git.\nTo start, let\u0026rsquo;s unravel the fundamental question: What is Git? Git is a distributed version control system, and the term \u0026ldquo;distributed\u0026rdquo; holds paramount significance. This sets Git apart from its predecessors like centralized systems such as SVN and CVS. In Git\u0026rsquo;s distributed ecosystem, each computer that has downloaded the repository maintains a complete copy of it. This feature enables you to work independently without relying on a centralized server. This is a crucial contrast to centralized systems like SVN. Why do we need Git or any version control system? The answer is simple: tracking changes to files is complex, especially when working individually or in teams.\nImagine a scenario where you\u0026rsquo;re crafting a web application composed of numerous files. After deploying it, you decide to make changes locally. Without version control, identifying which files were modified becomes challenging. Version control systems like Git address this problem. Consider collaborating with another developer. With Git, both of you can make changes to the same files without discord. Git handles merging changes seamlessly, resolving a common source of conflict.\nTransitioning to Git installation, the process is straightforward across all platforms. For Linux users, you can obtain Git via your preferred package manager. MacOS users can utilize Homebrew, while Windows users can download Git from git-scm.org. During the Windows installation, opting for Git Bash is crucial to attain a consistent command-line experience similar to Linux and MacOS.\nGit\u0026rsquo;s role transcends version control; it\u0026rsquo;s a software distribution medium. Platforms like GitLab and GitHub act as repositories, housing copies of projects. They often serve as master repositories, facilitating collaboration. While not mandatory, using these services streamlines sharing and synchronization.\nVenturing into using Git, let\u0026rsquo;s explore cloning repositories. Instead of merely downloading a zip file, the superior approach is using \u0026ldquo;git clone.\u0026rdquo; By copying the URL, running \u0026ldquo;git clone [URL]\u0026rdquo; you mirror the repository onto your system. It not only fetches code but also initializes Git-specific components. This association ensures you can update your local copy with any changes made on GitHub using \u0026ldquo;git pull.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s address creating repositories. Whether from existing code or a blank slate, the process remains consistent. Using \u0026ldquo;git init\u0026rdquo; in a folder initiates a Git repository. You can also create a new repository with a specified name using \u0026ldquo;git init [folder name].\u0026rdquo; This empowers you to manage both existing projects and new endeavors effectively.\nYou now comprehend the essence of Git, the role of repositories and how to install Git. Moreover, you\u0026rsquo;ve grasped how to clone repositories, making collaboration seamless and learned how to initialize your own repositories. This foundation equips you to traverse Git\u0026rsquo;s landscape with confidence and proficiency.\nhttps://git-scm.com/downloads https://git-scm.com/docs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\n","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/tech97/","section":"Tech","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Principles of Git.","title":"Tech","type":"tech"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/terminal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Terminal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/windows/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Windows","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/4kp60-hdmi-display/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"4Kp60 HDMI Display","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/i/o-performance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"I/O Performance","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mip-csi/dsi-ports/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MIP CSI/DSI Ports","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nvme/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NVMe","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pcie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PCIe","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ram/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"RAM","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/raspberry-pi-5/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Raspberry Pi 5","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/single-board-computer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Single-Board Computer","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Raspberry Pi 5\u0026rdquo; # 03/30/2024 # The Raspberry Pi 5 represents a significant advancement in the world of single-board computers.

If you\u0026rsquo;re one of these people, you could be missing out on some significant savings.\nFirst of all, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to check your monthly bill for a rental fee, which can range from $5 to $15, depending on your plan and ISP. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a modem/router combo unit, your ISP might add an extra Wi-Fi service fee on top of the rental fee. While some providers offer free modems with certain bundles, you might end up paying more in the long run due to these additional fees.\nIf your ISP allows you to use your own modem, you could save between $60 and $120 per year by buying one instead of renting it. Even though you\u0026rsquo;ll need to pay upfront for the modem, you\u0026rsquo;ll recoup the cost within a year and start saving $10 a month. Over time, these savings will add up. However, make sure your cable company stops charging you the rental fee since they\u0026rsquo;ve been known to \u0026ldquo;forget\u0026rdquo; in the past.\nKeep in mind that if you\u0026rsquo;re currently using a modem/router combo unit, it\u0026rsquo;s best to keep these devices separate. This means you\u0026rsquo;ll need to purchase a separate wireless router in addition to the modem. Although this might raise the cost of upgrading, it\u0026rsquo;s still worth it in the long run, especially if you need a mesh Wi-Fi system.\nWhile renting a modem might offer some benefits, such as being able to trade it in when it becomes obsolete or stops working, and not having to worry about compatibility or replacing the unit yourself, purchasing your own modem offers more advantages. Some ISPs might not even let you buy your own modem. If you have DSL or fiber, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to rent or purchase special equipment from your ISP since you can\u0026rsquo;t use a cable modem.\nIf you bundle your home phone service with your internet plan, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a modem with a phone port. However, telephony modems aren\u0026rsquo;t widely available for sale, and renting might be the better option.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to check your ISP\u0026rsquo;s website or contact customer service to see if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to use your own modem. Most ISPs will list compatible modems on their website.\nWhen it comes to choosing the right modem, PCMag doesn\u0026rsquo;t rate cable modems since it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to isolate modem performance from ISP speed. The best modem for you is one that\u0026rsquo;s compatible with your ISP and plan and offers a good balance of price and features. The best modems support DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 and are compatible with the major US cable companies, including Spectrum, Comcast, and Cox.\nFor plans slower than 1 Gigabit, a DOCSIS 3.0 modem is sufficient.
